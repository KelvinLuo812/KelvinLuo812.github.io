## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6, part 1
I like this lab because it makes learning command-line arguments feel practical and fun by building a simple Mad Lib, style program. It satisfying to see how a few inputs can generate a complete, customized sentence. The step-by-step process also helps reinforce good debugging and workflow habits. 


Lab 7, part 1
I like this lab because it turns tricky real world parking signs into clear logical rules I can code. It helps me practice writing and organizing multiple functions while also doing careful input validation. Its also satisfying to see the program decide allowed or not allowed based on the time and place.

Lab 9, part 2
I like this lab because it makes the guessing game feel more real by hiding the secret number in a file instead of showing it. It helps me practice both writing to and reading from files, plus handling errors when the file is missing or malformed. It also fun to see the two programs work together so that two players can actually play the game.
